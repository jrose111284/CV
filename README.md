## Jamie Rose

I have been blessed with a natural interest and ability in all areas of  IT.  Over the years, I have developed a broad range of skills including networking, diagnosing, and solving hardware and software problems, as well as a high level of general support. I am consistently learning new skills and am currently learning a program called swift.  Both committed and ambitious with a strong technical background, I believe I am an excellent candidate for any employer looking for someone who possesses the ability to work diligently alone or as part of a team.

## Skills

#### junior Web Developer

The Makers Academy course has encouraged me to keep coding with a energetic and positive attitude. I am so excited to be able to get to a stage where I can contribute to the development community through open-source projects. When I started at Makers Academy, I was nervous and unconfident about programing. However within just 16 weeks I can confidently build an end-to-end web app. Although I am more self-sufficient using Ruby-on-Rails, I also can uses other frame works like Sinatra and angular.js. I have proven my ability to pick up a new technology and continue my programing Career with confidence.
